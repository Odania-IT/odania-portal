# Why does the Odania Portal exist?

I have created several pages and build nearly the same base functionality every time.
I needed a possibility to manage different domains with different articles.
I looked around if something that would help me exists.
I looked at different cms systems, but most of them are build to manage a single domain.
If you want to manage multiple domains with one peace of software a lot less exists.
For some programms (like wordpress) plugins exist to help with this.
But i did not only want a blog, i wanted to be more flexible and extendable.
Drupal or Joomla give you more options. But also these are not the best for multiple domains.
I found some Java projects like Liferay Portal or Exo Plattform.
Both nearly do everything i want, but i also found here some problems.
In the end i decided to make my own Rails project to build a multi domain cms system.
